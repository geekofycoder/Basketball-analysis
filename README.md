📈 **Objective:** This project aims to analyze and visualize the relationship between player salaries, on-court performances, and team scores in the NBA over an 8-year period.

🔍 **Scope:** We've collected comprehensive data from the 2009-2017 seasons, including player statistics, salaries, and team scores, to offer a holistic view of the NBA's landscape during this timeframe.

## Tech Stack

- **NumPy**: We harness the power of NumPy for efficient data manipulation and computation. NumPy enables us to handle large datasets and perform complex mathematical operations with ease.

- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is our go-to tool for creating stunning data visualizations. From line plots to bar charts, we leverage Matplotlib's versatility to present our findings in a visually appealing manner.

## Key Features

📊 **Data Analysis**: We dive deep into player statistics, identifying trends and anomalies in performance metrics like points, assists, rebounds, and more.

💰 **Salary Insights**: Explore how player salaries have evolved over time and uncover any correlations between salaries and performance metrics.

🏀 **Team Performance**: Analyze team scores and investigate the impact of individual player performance on overall team success.

📈 **Interactive Visualizations**: Our project offers interactive charts and graphs that allow you to filter and explore the data according to your preferences.
